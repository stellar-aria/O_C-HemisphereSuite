Hemisphere Suite: Alternate-Alternate Firmware for Ornament and Crime
===

This is a fork of the Hemisphere Suite with some custom changes:

1. It compiles with PlatformIO and VS-Code
2. Add some original apps from OC firmware (see below)
3. NEW: Random Walk Applet: Dual channel (X/Y) clocked random walk with selectable range and step (CV controllable). A smoothing parameter can be used to morph stairs-like random walk to much more smooth walk. The second channel can be triggered using the first channel trigger signal with a configurable division.
4. NEW: Euclid: Euclidean rhythm like AnnularFusion but with more flexibility on the controls (both in app and with CV). Now [Phazerville](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/) suite graphic layout.
5. Adds new Hemisphere applet Stairs and TB-3PO by [Logarhythm1](https://github.com/Logarhythm1/O_C-HemisphereSuite/)
6. Adds new Hemisphere applet Shredder and DrumMap by [Ben Rosenbach](https://github.com/benirose/O_C-BenisphereSuite/)
7. Some HEM apps were also removed (see below)
